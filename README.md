# Spatial-Bias-In-Barcoding
This program was developed to assess and visualize spatial bias in DNA barcoding using a small dataset from the BOLD database (generated by the Canadian Barcode of Life Network). 
The dataset contains samples from various species as well as barcodes from groups that are economically and socially important to Canada. Approximately 98000 records with valid country metadata were georeferenced using centroid coordinates and visualized using a custom Python-based mapping program.
These were overlaid with 34 biodiversity hotspots to assess the alignment between global barcoding efforts and regions of conservation priority.
Countries within 20 degrees latitude/longitude of each hotspot centroid were considered 'nearby', and hotspots with fewer than 2 percent of total DNA barcoding studies in nearby countries were flagged as potentially undersampled.
